		This was one of the projects that was given to me when I worked for The City of Brandon. A Co-worker that also worked in the same building as I came to me asking to build him an ad for the Aboiriginal Youth Mentorship Program. Since the program was pointed towards kids I wanted it to look cool, catchy and flashy. With the different colours that I choose, the pattern that I included and the font aswell I got that cool, catchy and flashy look. I gave him three different pieces: this one, a low poly poster and a box layout one aswell.
