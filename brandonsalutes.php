		This is just a website design. Unfortunately while I was working there it never went into development. The navigation bar at the top of the screen would always stay there with the logo on the left and the menu items on the right. The background image would be fixed so that as the user scrolled it never moved. Instead of the big text text the name of the page that the user was on would be there instead.

	<p class="projecttext">
		As the user scrolled down the big text would scroll up and this white transparent box would slide up and then stay in place when it reached a certain position. Then as the user would continue to scroll the text would scroll.
