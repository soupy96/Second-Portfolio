		For an assignment in class I was to make a either a minimalist/retro poster. I decided to make chuckie from rugrats. I made his iconic hair and clothing and put a green background to make it stand out more. I also made a minimalistic Monsters Inc. and a minimalist/retro Iron Man poster for this assignment too.
