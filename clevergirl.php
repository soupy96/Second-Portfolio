		With this poster I was going for a minimalist look. I wanted the eye to stick out so that it was the most prominent item in the piece. So I made it red contrasting against the green. I added a shadow effect so that the eye looked like it was behind the leaves and looking through them. At the bottom I added the famous quote and the Jurassic Park logo to give it some context so that it just wasn't an eye looking through the leaves.
