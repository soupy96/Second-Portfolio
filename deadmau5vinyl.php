		We were told to make a vinyl front and back cover as well as the sticker that goes in the middle of the disk for both sides. This piece above was the front. Deadmau5, if you don't know is an techno artist that is known for wearing a helmet in the shape of a mouse with x's for it's eyes. I decided for the cover to mash together all of his previous album cover artwork into one to create a Deadmau5 Greatest Hit's vinyl. Each head on the cover represents an album in order that they were released to represent his progression as an techno artist.

		This is the back of that same vinyl. Since techno music is most often seen as futuristic and technological I wanted the text to look cool and techy.

		For the front side of the actuall vinyl I made the sticker above. It is just simply Deadmau5's iconic Deadmau5 helmet.

		Then for sticker that would go on the back of the vinyl I made it so that it looked like you were viewing his helmet from behind. I added a little cord to the back of the helmet to give it the feel the Deadmau5 is plugged into his music/laptop.
