		My class at Assiniboine Community College, Interactive Media Arts, were going on a industry encounters trip to Toronto. We had a plan of selling t-shirts to help fundraise for our trip. This was my design. If we wanted to keep our profits for our t-shirts up we had to use as few if colours as possible. So I stuck with blue and orange. The white that you see in the fox would either be white or transparent.
