		Every year the second year Interactive Media Arts students at Assiniboine Community College create an art gallery in the college. That year we decided to stick with a low poly theme. So I created these giraffes. The middle one is more colourful because it means to stand out from the crowd, to be different from the rest. With the use of different shades of the same colour I was able to create a 3D effect even with such little polies. I also added a drop shadow to add a little more to the 3D effect.
