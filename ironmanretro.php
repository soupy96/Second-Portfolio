		For an assignment in class I was to make a either a minimalist/retro poster. I decided to make a retro/minimalist Iron Man poster. I made the poster in the same design and effect of the older recruitment posters during the war. The single hero in front with his allies in the back, with the text "The hero burns inside you", to get the viewer excited or motivated.
