		Every year the second year Interactive Media Arts students at Assiniboine Community College create an art gallery in the college. That year we decided to stick with a low poly theme. So I created this low poly space scene. I made both the comet and the planet in low poly but still kept them looking like they were 3D. I acheived this by useing the same colour over again but with different shades to make it look like there was some definition to the object. The further the tail of the comet the more I increased the opacity of it while also taking out polies to make it look like it was dissipating.
