		For an assignment in class I was to make a either a minimalist/retro poster. I decided to make a minimalist Monsters Inc. poster. I wanted to create the three main characters from the movie so I created Sully, Mike and Boo. I wanted to keep them as simple as possible but still make them recognizable to the viewer. I then put them in order from biggest to smallest so that the viewer could get some kind of feeling about their scale.
