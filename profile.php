		When ever I get an idea for my profile picture I update it. This keeps my mind open to new design ideas while keeping my photoshop skills up to date. With this photo in perticular in wanted it to look like I was looking both frontwards and to the side. As I said before, I keep my profile picture up to date, with each one getting more indepth to create.
