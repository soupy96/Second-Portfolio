		I was given the task to create a logo for The Rapid City and District Chamber of Commerce. I created a red letter C and then with the negative space I was able to create the letter R, the first letters of Rapid City. Then with varying font sizes I made the legal title of the company.

		Since I had to create this for a company I had to show them what it would look like both in colour and black and white. So I created this piece to show them that.

		I wanted to create the same logo but put the image beside the text to show that the first design wasn't set in stone and that it could change.
